# Pre-Diagnosis Summary Service - Legacy Python Implementation
# This file is being replaced with a Node.js implementation for consistency
# with other AI services in the platform.
#
# The new implementation can be found in:
# - src/app.js (main application)
# - src/services/preDiagnosisSummary.service.js (core service)
# - src/models/ (data models)
# - src/controllers/ (API controllers)
#
# This file is kept for reference during the migration period.
