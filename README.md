# Dr. Assistant - AI-Powered Healthcare Solution( in-progress )

Dr. Assistant is an AI-powered application designed to streamline doctor workflows, reduce administrative burden, and improve patient care in the Indian healthcare system. The platform uses voice recognition, AI summarization, and intelligent scheduling to help doctors focus more on patients and less on paperwork.

## Project Overview

This repository contains documentation and development plans for the Dr. Assistant platform, which aims to address key challenges in the Indian healthcare system:

- High patient volumes and limited doctor time

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Only Docker is required!** No need to install Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or any other dependencies locally.

- **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- **Git** - For cloning the repository

### üöÄ Quick Start (Docker - Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd doc_assistant_new

# Start the application (one command!)
npm run start

# Or use the platform-specific scripts
# For Linux/Mac:
bash start.sh

# For Windows:
start.bat
```

This will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Create .env file from template
- ‚úÖ Start all databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- ‚úÖ Start all backend services
- ‚úÖ Start AI services
- ‚úÖ Start frontend application
- ‚úÖ Set up networking between services

### Alternative: Local Development (Advanced)

If you prefer to run services locally with npm:

```bash
# Start only databases with Docker
npm run start:databases

# Start services locally (requires Node.js 18+)
npm run dev:local
```

```

### Troubleshooting

#### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection issues:

1. Check if the database services are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Verify the database credentials in your .env files match those in docker-compose.yml

3. For PostgreSQL issues:
   ```bash
   # Connect to the PostgreSQL container
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d dr_assistant

   # Check if the database exists
   \l

   # Check if tables exist
   \dt
   ```

4. For MongoDB issues:
   ```bash
   # Connect to the MongoDB container
   docker-compose exec mongodb mongo -u mongo -p mongo --authenticationDatabase admin dr_assistant

   # Check collections
   show collections
   ```

#### Service Startup Issues

If services fail to start:

1. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs auth_service
   ```

2. Verify all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   cd backend/auth_service
   npm install
   ```

3. Check if required environment variables are set in your .env files

#### Frontend Build Issues

If the frontend fails to build:

1. Check for TypeScript errors:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/web
   npm run lint
   ```

2. Verify dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Clear the build cache:
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   ```

### Development Workflow

Refer to the [Development Workflow](./docs/product/product_features/overall_app_implementation/Development_Workflow.md) document for detailed information on the development process, including branching strategy, code reviews, and testing procedures.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Continuous Integration**: Runs linting, testing, and building on every pull request and push to main/develop branches
- **Continuous Deployment to Development**: Automatically deploys to the development environment when code is pushed to the develop branch
- **Continuous Deployment to Production**: Automatically deploys to the production environment when code is pushed to the main branch

For more information, see the [CI/CD Pipeline Documentation](./docs/development/CI_CD_Pipeline.md).
