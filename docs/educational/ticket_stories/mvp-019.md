## The Story Behind the Ticket

Task management is a critical component of any healthcare workflow system. Doctors and healthcare professionals juggle numerous responsibilities throughout their day - from completing patient documentation to reviewing lab results, scheduling follow-ups, and managing referrals. Without a systematic approach to task management, important activities can be overlooked, leading to delays in patient care and increased stress for healthcare providers.

The Task Service addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive task management system specifically designed for healthcare workflows. It enables doctors to create, assign, prioritize, and track tasks related to patient care, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. The service supports various task types common in healthcare settings and provides intelligent features like due date tracking, overdue notifications, and priority-based organization.

This implementation goes beyond simple to-do lists by integrating with the broader Dr. Assistant ecosystem, linking tasks to specific patients and encounters, and providing role-based access control to ensure sensitive information is properly protected.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Design

We've implemented a comprehensive database schema with the `tasks` table that includes:

**Core Task Fields:**
- `id` - UUID primary key for unique identification
- `title` - Brief task description (max 100 characters)
- `description` - Detailed task information
- `task_type` - Categorization (documentation, review, follow_up, referral, order, other)

**Assignment and Ownership:**
- `created_by` - User who created the task
- `assigned_to` - User assigned to complete the task
- `patient_id` - Optional link to specific patient
- `encounter_id` - Optional link to specific encounter

**Priority and Status Management:**
- `priority` - Four levels (low, medium, high, urgent)
- `status` - Workflow states (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- `due_date` - When the task should be completed
- `completed_at` - Automatically set when task is completed

**Audit Trail:**
- `created_at` - Task creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last modification timestamp (auto-updated)

### 2. Task Model Implementation

The Task model includes sophisticated business logic:

**Instance Methods:**
- `isOverdue()` - Checks if task is past due date
- `isDueToday()` - Checks if task is due today
- `getDaysUntilDue()` - Calculates days until due date
- `canBeAssigned()` - Validates if task can be assigned
- `canBeCompleted()` - Validates if task can be completed
- `getDisplayInfo()` - Returns formatted task information

**Class Methods:**
- `findPending()` - Retrieves pending tasks with filtering
- `findOverdue()` - Finds tasks past their due date
- `findDueToday()` - Gets tasks due today
- `findByAssignee()` - Tasks assigned to specific user
- `findByCreator()` - Tasks created by specific user
- `findByPatient()` - Tasks related to specific patient

### 3. Service Layer Architecture

The Task Service provides comprehensive business logic:

**Task CRUD Operations:**
- Create tasks with validation and default values
- Retrieve tasks with access control
- Update tasks with permission checks
- Delete tasks with ownership validation

**Advanced Task Management:**
- Status transitions with validation rules
- Task assignment with permission checks
- Priority-based sorting and filtering
- Due date management and overdue detection

**Access Control:**
- Users can access tasks they created or are assigned to
- Admins have full access to all tasks
- Patient-specific tasks respect patient access permissions

### 4. API Design

We've implemented a comprehensive RESTful API:

**Core CRUD Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `GET /api/tasks` - List tasks with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get specific task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task

**Status Management:**
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/status` - Update task status
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/assign` - Assign task to user

**Specialized Queries:**
- `GET /api/tasks/pending` - Get pending tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/overdue` - Get overdue tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/due-today` - Get tasks due today
- `GET /api/tasks/assigned/:userId` - Get user's assigned tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/created/:userId` - Get user's created tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/patient/:patientId` - Get patient-related tasks

### 5. Validation and Security

**Input Validation:**
- Comprehensive validation using express-validator
- Custom business rule validation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

**Authentication and Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permission checks

**Data Integrity:**
- Database constraints and triggers
- Automatic timestamp management
- Status transition validation

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Access Control

Healthcare data requires sophisticated access control where users should only see tasks they're involved with, while admins need broader access.

**Solution:** We implemented a multi-layered access control system that checks task ownership, assignment, and user roles. The system automatically filters queries based on user permissions, ensuring data security without compromising functionality.

### Challenge 2: Status Transition Management

Task status changes need to follow logical workflows and maintain data integrity.

**Solution:** We implemented a state machine approach with validation rules for status transitions. The system prevents invalid transitions (like moving from completed back to pending) while allowing logical workflows. Database triggers automatically manage timestamps like `completed_at`.

### Challenge 3: Performance with Large Task Lists

Healthcare environments can generate thousands of tasks, requiring efficient querying and pagination.

**Solution:** We implemented comprehensive database indexing, efficient query patterns, and pagination support. The system can handle large task volumes while maintaining fast response times through strategic index placement and query optimization.

### Challenge 4: Integration with Other Services

Tasks need to integrate with users, patients, and encounters while maintaining loose coupling.

**Solution:** We used UUID references for integration points and implemented graceful handling of missing references. The service can operate independently while providing rich functionality when integrated with other services.

## Impact and Outcomes

Completing this ticket provides:

1. **Complete Task Management System**: Healthcare professionals can now create, assign, and track tasks throughout their workflow.

2. **Priority-Based Organization**: Tasks are automatically sorted by priority and due date, helping users focus on the most important items.

3. **Comprehensive Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by status, type, assignee, patient, and due date to find exactly what they need.

4. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of task creation, updates, and completion for compliance and analysis.

5. **Integration Ready**: The service is designed to integrate seamlessly with other Dr. Assistant components.

6. **Scalable Architecture**: The system can handle growing task volumes and user bases efficiently.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Database Design Importance**: Proper indexing and constraints from the beginning prevent performance issues and data integrity problems later.

2. **Access Control Complexity**: Healthcare applications require sophisticated access control that goes beyond simple role-based permissions.

3. **State Management**: Task status transitions need careful design to prevent invalid states and maintain workflow integrity.

4. **API Design Consistency**: Following RESTful conventions while providing specialized endpoints creates an intuitive and powerful API.
