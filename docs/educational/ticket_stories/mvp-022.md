**Ticket ID:** MVP-022  
**Title:** Implement Voice Recording Service  
**Type:** Feature  
**Sprint:** Sprint 4 - AI Pipeline & Voice Recording  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** Highest  
**Owner:** Anil  
**Reviewers:** Kushal

## The Story Behind the Ticket

### Business Context
The Dr. Assistant platform's core value proposition centers around AI-powered clinical documentation. To achieve this, we need a robust foundation for capturing, storing, and processing voice recordings of doctor-patient conversations. This ticket represents the critical first step in our AI pipeline - secure voice data ingestion.

### Technical Challenge
Building a voice recording service in healthcare requires addressing multiple complex requirements:
- **Security**: Medical conversations contain highly sensitive PHI (Protected Health Information)
- **Compliance**: Must meet healthcare data protection standards
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent recordings from different doctors
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss tolerance for medical recordings
- **Performance**: Efficient storage and retrieval of large audio files

### User Story
*"As a doctor, I want to securely record my conversations with patients so that the AI system can generate accurate clinical notes, allowing me to focus on patient care rather than documentation."*

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Microservice Design
We implemented the voice recording service as an independent microservice following our established architecture patterns:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dedicated service for audio handling
- **Scalability**: Can scale independently based on recording volume
- **Security Isolation**: Audio data handling isolated from other services
- **Technology Flexibility**: Can use specialized audio processing libraries

#### 2. Storage Strategy - MongoDB GridFS
**Decision**: Use MongoDB GridFS for audio file storage
**Rationale**:
- **Large File Handling**: GridFS designed for files >16MB
- **Chunked Storage**: Automatic file chunking for efficient streaming
- **Metadata Integration**: Rich metadata storage alongside audio files
- **Consistency**: Maintains ACID properties with document database
- **Backup Integration**: Seamless backup with existing MongoDB infrastructure

#### 3. Security Implementation
**Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption for all audio files
```javascript
// Encryption implementation
const encryptionData = encryptionService.encrypt(audioBuffer);
const storageResult = await audioStorageService.storeAudioFile(audioBuffer, {
  ...recordingData,
  encryption: encryptionData
});
```

**Access Control**: JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization
**Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all audio operations

#### 4. Data Model Design
```javascript
// Voice Recording Schema
{
  encounterId: "UUID",           // Links to clinical encounter
  patientId: "UUID",             // Patient identifier
  doctorId: "UUID",              // Recording doctor
  duration: Number,              // Recording length in seconds
  fileSize: Number,              // File size in bytes
  mimeType: String,              // Audio format
  status: String,                // Processing status
  encryption: {                  // Encryption metadata
    algorithm: "aes-256-gcm",
    keyId: String,
    iv: String,
    authTag: String
  },
  retentionPolicy: {             // Data retention rules
    expiresAt: Date,
    retentionReason: String,
    retentionDays: Number
  },
  metadata: {                    // Rich metadata
    deviceInfo: String,
    quality: String,
    uploadedBy: String,
    processingStats: Object
  }
}
```
