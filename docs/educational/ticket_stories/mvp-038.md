## The Story Behind the Ticket

### Why This Ticket Matters

As Dr. Assistant has evolved into a sophisticated microservices architecture, a new challenge has emerged: the complexity of running the complete application during development. With each service running independently, developers must start multiple services, manage their dependencies, and ensure proper communication between them. This fragmented approach creates several pain points:

1. **Development Friction**: Developers spend valuable time starting and managing multiple services instead of focusing on feature development.

2. **Onboarding Hurdles**: New team members face a steep learning curve understanding how to run the complete application.

3. **Environment Inconsistencies**: Different developers may run services with inconsistent configurations, leading to "works on my machine" problems.

4. **Testing Challenges**: End-to-end testing becomes difficult when services must be manually coordinated.

5. **Integration Blind Spots**: Developers may miss integration issues when they don't regularly run all services together.

MVP-038 addresses these challenges by creating a streamlined orchestration solution that allows developers to run the entire application with minimal effort. This seemingly simple DevOps improvement will have profound effects on development velocity, code quality, and team collaboration.

### The Technical Implementation

#### 1. Docker Compose Configuration

The centerpiece of our solution is a comprehensive Docker Compose configuration that defines all services, their dependencies, and their environment:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  auth-service:
    build: ./backend/auth_service
    ports:
      - "8001:8001"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=8001
      - DB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/auth
    depends_on:
      - mongo
      - redis
    volumes:
      - ./backend/auth_service:/app
      - /app/node_modules

  user-service:
    build: ./backend/user_service
    ports:
      - "8002:8002"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=8002
      - DB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/users
      - AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://auth-service:8001
    depends_on:
      - mongo
      - redis
      - auth-service
    volumes:
      - ./backend/user_service:/app
      - /app/node_modules

  # Additional services defined similarly...

  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword

  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=dr_assistant
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data

volumes:
  mongo-data:
  postgres-data:
  redis-data:
```

This configuration:
- Defines each microservice with its build context, port mappings, and environment variables
- Sets up shared infrastructure (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Establishes service dependencies to ensure proper startup order
- Mounts local code directories for live code reloading during development
- Persists database data across container restarts

#### 2. Development Startup Script

For developers who prefer not to use Docker, we've created a bash script that starts all services in development mode:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# start-services.sh

# Set up environment
export NODE_ENV=development

# Create log directory
mkdir -p logs

# Function to start a service
start_service() {
  SERVICE_NAME=$1
  SERVICE_DIR=$2
  PORT=$3
  
  echo "Starting $SERVICE_NAME on port $PORT..."
  cd $SERVICE_DIR
  npm run dev > ../../logs/$SERVICE_NAME.log 2>&1 &
  PID=$!
  echo "$PID" > ../../logs/$SERVICE_NAME.pid
  cd ../..
  echo "$SERVICE_NAME started with PID $PID"
}

# Start infrastructure services if not using Docker
# (MongoDB, Redis, etc. should be running locally)

# Start application services
start_service "auth-service" "backend/auth_service" 8001
start_service "user-service" "backend/user_service" 8002
start_service "patient-service" "backend/patient_service" 8003
start_service "schedule-service" "backend/schedule_service" 8004
start_service "dashboard-service" "backend/dashboard_service" 8005

# Add future services here as they are developed

echo "All services started. Logs available in the logs directory."
echo "To stop all services, run ./stop-services.sh"
```

We've also created a companion script to gracefully shut down all services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# stop-services.sh

echo "Stopping all services..."

# Stop each service by PID
for pidfile in logs/*.pid; do
  if [ -f "$pidfile" ]; then
    SERVICE_NAME=$(basename "$pidfile" .pid)
    PID=$(cat "$pidfile")
    
    echo "Stopping $SERVICE_NAME (PID: $PID)..."
    kill -15 $PID
    rm "$pidfile"
  fi
done

echo "All services stopped."
```

#### 3. Environment Variable Management

To ensure consistent configuration across services, we've implemented a centralized environment variable management system:

1. **Base Configuration File**: A `.env.example` file in the project root with common settings
2. **Service-Specific Overrides**: Individual `.env.example` files in each service directory
3. **Environment Inheritance**: Docker Compose environment variables that cascade to services

```
# .env.example (root)
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=debug
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
POSTGRES_URI=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/dr_assistant
REDIS_URI=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=development_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRY=1d
```

#### 4. Service Discovery and Communication

We've implemented a simple service discovery mechanism for development:

1. **Fixed Port Assignments**: Each service has a designated port (8001-8010)
2. **Service URLs in Environment**: Environment variables for inter-service communication
3. **Docker Network**: Services in Docker Compose communicate via container names

```javascript
// Example of service communication in dashboard_service
const scheduleServiceClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.SCHEDULE_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:8004',
  timeout: 5000
});
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Managing Service Dependencies

**Challenge:** Ensuring services start in the correct order, with dependent services waiting for their prerequisites to be ready.

**Solution:** We implemented a multi-faceted approach:

1. **Docker Compose `depends_on`**: Defined service dependencies in Docker Compose:

```yaml
dashboard-service:
  # ...
  depends_on:
    - redis
    - auth-service
    - user-service
    - patient-service
    - schedule-service
```

2. **Health Check Polling**: Added service readiness checks in the startup script:

```bash
wait_for_service() {
  SERVICE_NAME=$1
  URL=$2
  MAX_RETRIES=$3
  
  echo "Waiting for $SERVICE_NAME to be ready..."
  
  for i in $(seq 1 $MAX_RETRIES); do
    if curl -s $URL/health > /dev/null; then
      echo "$SERVICE_NAME is ready!"
      return 0
    fi
    
    echo "Attempt $i/$MAX_RETRIES: $SERVICE_NAME not ready yet, waiting..."
    sleep 2
  done
  
  echo "Error: $SERVICE_NAME did not become ready in time."
  return 1
}

# Start auth service first
start_service "auth-service" "backend/auth_service" 8001

# Wait for auth service before starting user service
wait_for_service "auth-service" "http://localhost:8001" 30
start_service "user-service" "backend/user_service" 8002
```

3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Implemented retry logic in services for temporary dependency failures:

```javascript
const connectToService = async (serviceUrl, maxRetries = 5, retryDelay = 2000) => {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`${serviceUrl}/health`);
      if (response.status === 200) {
        logger.info(`Successfully connected to service at ${serviceUrl}`);
        return true;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warn(`Attempt ${attempt}/${maxRetries} to connect to ${serviceUrl} failed: ${error.message}`);
      if (attempt < maxRetries) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryDelay));
      }
    }
  }
  logger.error(`Failed to connect to service at ${serviceUrl} after ${maxRetries} attempts`);
  return false;
};
```

### Challenge 2: Database Initialization and Migration

**Challenge:** Ensuring databases are properly initialized with schemas and initial data when the application starts.

**Solution:** We created a database initialization system:

1. **Init Scripts for Docker**: Added initialization scripts for Docker database containers:

```
backend/
  db/
    mongo-init/
      01-create-users.js
      02-create-indexes.js
    postgres-init/
      01-create-tables.sql
      02-create-functions.sql
```

2. **Docker Volume Mounting**: Mounted these scripts in the Docker Compose configuration:

```yaml
mongo:
  # ...
  volumes:
    - ./backend/db/mongo-init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    - mongo-data:/data/db

postgres:
  # ...
  volumes:
    - ./backend/db/postgres-init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

3. **Migration Scripts**: Added database migration scripts for schema updates:

```javascript
// Example migration script
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function migrateDatabase() {
  const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGO_URI);
  
  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('dr_assistant');
    
    // Check migration version
    const migrations = db.collection('migrations');
    const latestMigration = await migrations.findOne({}, { sort: { version: -1 } });
    const currentVersion = latestMigration ? latestMigration.version : 0;
    
    // Apply migrations
    if (currentVersion < 1) {
      console.log('Applying migration 1: Add indexes to patients collection');
      await db.collection('patients').createIndex({ abha_id: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true });
      await migrations.insertOne({ version: 1, appliedAt: new Date() });
    }
    
    // Additional migrations...
    
    console.log('Database migration completed successfully');
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

migrateDatabase().catch(console.error);
```

### Challenge 3: Consistent Logging Across Services

**Challenge:** Implementing a consistent logging approach across all microservices to make debugging easier.

**Solution:** We standardized logging with a shared logging module:

1. **Centralized Logging Configuration**: Created a shared logging module:

```javascript
// shared/logging.js
const winston = require('winston');

const createLogger = (serviceName) => {
  return winston.createLogger({
    level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
    format: winston.format.combine(
      winston.format.timestamp(),
      winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
      winston.format.json()
    ),
    defaultMeta: { service: serviceName },
    transports: [
      new winston.transports.Console({
        format: winston.format.combine(
          winston.format.colorize(),
          winston.format.printf(({ timestamp, level, message, service, ...rest }) => {
            return `${timestamp} [${service}] ${level}: ${message} ${Object.keys(rest).length ? JSON.stringify(rest) : ''}`;
          })
        )
      }),
      new winston.transports.File({ 
        filename: `logs/${serviceName}-error.log`, 
        level: 'error' 
      }),
      new winston.transports.File({ 
        filename: `logs/${serviceName}-combined.log` 
      })
    ]
  });
};

module.exports = { createLogger };
```

2. **Log Aggregation**: Set up log collection in a central location:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  # ...
  log-collector:
    image: gliderlabs/logspout
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    command: syslog://logs.example.com:514
    restart: always
```

## Impact and Outcomes

The implementation of the Development Environment Orchestration has had significant impacts on the development process:

1. **Increased Developer Productivity**: Developers now spend less time setting up and managing services, allowing them to focus on feature development.

2. **Improved Onboarding Experience**: New team members can get the entire application running with just a few commands, reducing onboarding time from days to hours.

3. **Consistent Environments**: All developers now work with the same service configurations, eliminating "works on my machine" problems.

4. **Better Integration Testing**: With the ability to easily run all services together, integration issues are caught earlier in the development process.

5. **Enhanced Collaboration**: The team now has a shared understanding of how services interact, leading to better architectural decisions.

## Lessons Learned

1. **DevOps Investment Pays Off**: Investing time in development tooling yields significant returns in productivity and code quality.

2. **Start Early**: Implementing orchestration early in the project prevents the accumulation of inconsistent practices across services.

3. **Documentation is Crucial**: Clear documentation on how to use the orchestration tools is as important as the tools themselves.

4. **Flexibility Matters**: Supporting both Docker and non-Docker workflows accommodates different developer preferences and environments.

5. **Monitoring and Debugging**: Integrated logging and monitoring from the start makes troubleshooting much easier as the application grows.

## Connection to Other Tickets

The Development Environment Orchestration connects to several other tickets in our development roadmap:

- **MVP-013 (Implement Daily Dashboard Backend)**: The dashboard service's integration with multiple other services highlighted the need for better orchestration.

- **All Microservice Tickets**: Every microservice benefits from the standardized environment and simplified startup process.

- **Future CI/CD Tickets**: The Docker Compose configuration provides a foundation for future continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## Conclusion

The Development Environment Orchestration ticket may seem like a purely technical improvement, but its impact extends far beyond the codebase. By simplifying the development workflow, we've removed friction that was slowing down the team and created a foundation for more efficient collaboration.

As Dr. Assistant continues to grow with more microservices, this orchestration layer will become increasingly valuable, ensuring that complexity in the architecture doesn't translate to complexity in the development experience. The patterns established here will guide future DevOps improvements and help maintain development velocity as the application scales.

This ticket exemplifies our commitment to developer experience and engineering excellence, recognizing that how we build is just as important as what we build.
