# Dr. Assistant Ticket Stories

## Overview

This folder contains detailed stories about the implementation of each ticket in the Dr. Assistant project. These stories are written for educational purposes to provide deep technical insights into how each feature was developed, the challenges faced, and the solutions implemented.

## Purpose

The ticket stories serve several important purposes:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: They provide a comprehensive record of how and why technical decisions were made, making it easier for new team members to understand the codebase.

2. **Educational Resource**: They serve as a learning resource for developers interested in understanding how a complex healthcare application is built from the ground up.

3. **Technical Documentation**: They document the technical implementation details of each feature, complementing the more formal documentation.

4. **Historical Context**: They capture the context and reasoning behind implementation choices, which can be valuable for future maintenance and enhancements.

## Structure

Each ticket story follows a consistent structure:

### 1. Ticket Overview
Basic information about the ticket, including ID, title, description, owner, and priority.

### 2. The Story Behind the Ticket
Explanation of why the ticket was important and how it fits into the overall project.

### 3. Technical Implementation
Detailed explanation of how the ticket was implemented, including:
- Code examples
- Architecture diagrams
- Database schemas
- API designs
- UI/UX considerations

### 4. Challenges and Solutions
Discussion of the challenges faced during implementation and how they were overcome.

### 5. Impact and Outcomes
Analysis of how the implementation affected the project and what outcomes were achieved.

### 6. Lessons Learned
Reflection on what was learned during the implementation and what could be improved.

### 7. Connection to Other Tickets
Explanation of how the ticket relates to other tickets in the project.

## How to Use These Stories

These stories can be used in several ways:

1. **Onboarding**: New team members can read these stories to understand how the application was built and why certain decisions were made.

2. **Learning**: Developers can learn about specific technologies and patterns by studying how they were implemented in a real-world application.

3. **Reference**: When working on enhancements or bug fixes, developers can refer to these stories to understand the original implementation.

4. **Inspiration**: The challenges and solutions described in these stories can inspire approaches to similar problems in other projects.

## Contributing

When implementing a new ticket, please create a corresponding ticket story following the established structure. The story should be written after the ticket is completed, capturing not just what was done but also the reasoning, challenges, and lessons learned.

Use the following filename convention:
```
mvp-XXX.md
```
Where XXX is the ticket number (e.g., mvp-001.md, mvp-002.md).

## Note on Code Examples

The code examples in these stories should be actual code from the implementation, not pseudocode. However, they may be simplified or excerpted for clarity. Always refer to the actual codebase for the complete and current implementation.

## Maintenance

These stories should be treated as living documents. If significant changes are made to a feature after its initial implementation, the corresponding story should be updated to reflect those changes.

However, the original context and reasoning should be preserved, with updates clearly marked as such. This preserves the historical record while keeping the documentation current.
