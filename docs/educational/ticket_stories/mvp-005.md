## The Story Behind the Ticket

### Why This Ticket Matters

In a healthcare application like Dr. Assistant, security isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental requirement. MVP-005 was dedicated to creating a comprehensive security implementation plan that would guide all aspects of security throughout the application.

This ticket was critical because:

1. It established the authentication strategy that would secure user access
2. It defined the authorization model that would control what users can do
3. It outlined the data protection approach to safeguard sensitive patient information
4. It addressed compliance requirements for healthcare data (DPDP Act, ABDM)

Security breaches in healthcare applications can have severe consequences, including compromised patient data, regulatory penalties, and loss of trust. MVP-005 was about ensuring that security was built into the foundation of our application, not added as an afterthought.

### The Technical Implementation

## 1. Authentication Strategy

### 1.1 JWT-Based Authentication

#### Implementation Details

- **Technology**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with OAuth 2.0
- **Library**: `jsonwebtoken` for Node.js services
- **Token Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "header": {
      "alg": "RS256",
      "typ": "JWT"
    },
    "payload": {
      "sub": "<user_id>",
      "name": "<user_name>",
      "role": "<user_role>",
      "iat": "<issued_at>",
      "exp": "<expiration_time>",
      "jti": "<token_id>"
    },
    "signature": "..."
  }
  ```

#### Token Lifecycle

1. **Access Token**:
   - Short-lived (15 minutes)
   - Used for API authentication
   - Stored in memory on client-side

2. **Refresh Token**:
   - Longer-lived (7 days)
   - Used to obtain new access tokens
   - Stored in HTTP-only secure cookie
   - One-time use with rotation

### JWT Implementation

```javascript
// Generate access token
function generateAccessToken(user) {
  const payload = {
    sub: user.id,
    name: user.fullName,
    role: user.role,
    permissions: user.permissions,
    iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (15 * 60), // 15 minutes
    jti: uuidv4()
  };
  
  return jwt.sign(payload, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' });
}
```

#### 3. Authorization Model

We defined a comprehensive authorization model combining Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):

```markdown
# Authorization Model

## Overview

This document details the authorization model for the Dr. Assistant application, focusing on the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to ensure proper access to resources.

## Authorization Approach

The Dr. Assistant application uses a hybrid authorization approach combining:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: For coarse-grained permissions based on user roles
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: For fine-grained permissions based on user, resource, and environmental attributes

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Role Hierarchy

```
┌───────────┐
│           │
│  Admin    │
│           │
└─────┬─────┘
      │
      │
┌─────┴─────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│           │     │           │     │           │
│  Doctor   │     │  Nurse    │     │Reception  │
│           │     │           │     │           │
└───────────┘     └───────────┘     └───────────┘
```

### RBAC Implementation

```javascript
// Check if user has permission
async function hasPermission(userId, resource, action) {
  const permissions = await getUserPermissions(userId);
  return permissions.some(p => p.resource === resource && p.action === action);
}
```

## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

### Policy Structure

```json
{
  "id": "policy-123",
  "description": "Allow doctors to view their patients' records",
  "effect": "allow",
  "target": {
    "resource": {
      "type": "patient"
    },
    "action": {
      "type": "read"
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "user.role": "doctor",
    "resource.assignedDoctorId": "${user.id}"
  }
}
```

```

#### 4. Data Encryption Approach

We documented a detailed data encryption approach for protecting sensitive data:

```markdown
# Data Encryption Approach

## Overview

This document details the data encryption approach for the Dr. Assistant application, covering encryption at rest, encryption in transit, and end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.

## Encryption at Rest

### Database Encryption

#### PostgreSQL Encryption

```sql
-- Enable pgcrypto extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

-- Create table with encrypted columns
CREATE TABLE patients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  mrn VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  -- Encrypted columns
  phone_encrypted BYTEA,
  email_encrypted BYTEA,
  address_encrypted BYTEA,
  -- Other columns
  date_of_birth DATE,
  gender VARCHAR(10),
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Functions to encrypt and decrypt
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION encrypt_data(data TEXT, key TEXT)
RETURNS BYTEA AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN pgp_sym_encrypt(data, key);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Key Management

```javascript
// Key management service
class KeyManagementService {
  constructor(vaultClient) {
    this.vaultClient = vaultClient;
  }
  
  // Get master key
  async getMasterKey() {
    const response = await this.vaultClient.read('secret/data/master-key');
    return response.data.data.value;
  }
  
  // Generate data key
  async generateDataKey(keyType) {
    // Generate random key
    const dataKey = crypto.randomBytes(32);
    
    // Get master key
    const masterKey = await this.getMasterKey();
    
    // Encrypt data key with master key
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Security and Usability

**Challenge:** We needed to implement strong security measures without compromising the usability of the application, especially for healthcare professionals who need quick access to patient information.

**Solution:** We implemented a layered security approach that balanced security and usability:

1. **Risk-Based Authentication**: We designed an authentication system that adjusts security requirements based on the risk level of the action being performed.

```javascript
// Example of risk-based authentication logic
function determineAuthenticationRequirements(user, action, resource) {
  // Calculate risk score based on various factors
  const riskScore = calculateRiskScore(user, action, resource);
  
  // Determine authentication requirements based on risk score
  if (riskScore >= 80) {
    return { requireMFA: true, sessionTimeout: 5 * 60 * 1000 }; // 5 minutes
  } else if (riskScore >= 50) {
    return { requireMFA: false, sessionTimeout: 15 * 60 * 1000 }; // 15 minutes
  } else {
    return { requireMFA: false, sessionTimeout: 30 * 60 * 1000 }; // 30 minutes
  }
}
```

2. **Context-Aware Authorization**: We designed an authorization system that considers the context of the request, such as the user's role, the time of day, and the location.

3. **Emergency Access Procedures**: We planned for emergency access procedures that would allow healthcare professionals to access critical information in emergency situations, with appropriate auditing and post-access review.

### Challenge 2: Compliance with Multiple Regulations

**Challenge:** We needed to ensure compliance with multiple regulations, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) and ABDM requirements, which sometimes had overlapping or conflicting requirements.

**Solution:** We created a unified compliance framework that mapped all requirements to specific implementation tasks:

1. **Requirement Mapping**: We mapped each regulatory requirement to specific technical implementations.

2. **Compliance Matrix**: We created a compliance matrix that showed how each feature addressed multiple regulatory requirements.

3. **Automated Compliance Checks**: We planned for automated compliance checks as part of our CI/CD pipeline.

```javascript
// Example of a compliance check for data retention
function checkDataRetentionCompliance() {
  const retentionPolicies = getDataRetentionPolicies();
  const dataStores = getAllDataStores();
  
  const complianceIssues = [];
  
  for (const dataStore of dataStores) {
    for (const dataType of dataStore.dataTypes) {
      const policy = retentionPolicies[dataType];
      
      if (!policy) {
        complianceIssues.push(`No retention policy defined for ${dataType} in ${dataStore.name}`);
        continue;
      }
      
      if (!dataStore.supportsRetention) {
        complianceIssues.push(`Data store ${dataStore.name} does not support retention policies for ${dataType}`);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return complianceIssues;
}
```

### Challenge 3: Key Management

**Challenge:** Secure key management was critical for our encryption strategy, but implementing a robust key management system is complex.

**Solution:** We designed a key management approach using HashiCorp Vault:

1. **Key Hierarchy**: We established a clear key hierarchy with master keys and data keys.

2. **Key Rotation**: We designed a key rotation strategy to regularly rotate encryption keys without disrupting service.

3. **Secure Storage**: We planned to use HashiCorp Vault for secure storage of encryption keys.

```javascript
// Example of key rotation logic
async function rotateDataKeys() {
  const keyTypes = await keyManagementService.getKeyTypes();
  
  for (const keyType of keyTypes) {
    // Generate new data key
    const newKey = await keyManagementService.generateDataKey(keyType);
    
    // Get data encrypted with old key
    const encryptedData = await dataRepository.findByKeyType(keyType);
    
    // Re-encrypt data with new key
    for (const data of encryptedData) {
      const decryptedValue = await encryptionService.decrypt(data.value, data.keyId);
      const reEncryptedValue = await encryptionService.encrypt(decryptedValue, newKey.id);
      
      await dataRepository.update(data.id, {
        value: reEncryptedValue,
        keyId: newKey.id
      });
    }
    
    // Archive old key
    await keyManagementService.archiveKey(keyType);
  }
}
```

## Impact and Outcomes
