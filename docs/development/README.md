## Getting Started

Developers should start by reviewing the following documents:

1. [System Architecture](./architecture/System_Architecture.md) - Understand the high-level architecture
2. [Project Structure](./implementation/Project_Structure.md) - Learn about the codebase organization
3. [Development Workflow](./workflow/Development_Workflow.md) - Understand the development process
4. [Technology Stack](./implementation/Technology_Stack.md) - Familiarize yourself with the technologies used

## Development Process

The development process follows an Agile methodology with two-week sprints. For detailed information about the development process, refer to the [Development Workflow](./workflow/Development_Workflow.md) document.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan outlines the steps for developing the Dr. Assistant application. For detailed information about the implementation plan, refer to the [Implementation Plan](./implementation/Implementation_Plan.md) document.

## Testing

The testing strategy outlines the approach to testing the Dr. Assistant application. For detailed information about testing, refer to the [Testing Strategy](./testing/Testing_Strategy.md) document.

## Relationship with Product Documentation

The technical documentation in this directory complements the product documentation found in `/docs/product`. While the product documentation focuses on what features to build and why, the development documentation focuses on how to build them.

Key product documentation to reference:

1. [Doctor App Features](../product/product_features/Doctor_App_Features.md) - Detailed description of application features
2. [Product Development Plan](../product/product_features/Product_Development_Plan.md) - Overall product roadmap and vision

The technical implementation details in this directory are derived from the product requirements and are designed to support the product vision while ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and secure application.
