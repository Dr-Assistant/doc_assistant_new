   - Requires pull request and approval

2. **Feature Branches**
   - Named with convention: `feature/[issue-number]-[brief-description]`
   - Created from `main`
   - Merged back to `main` via pull request

3. **Bugfix Branches**
   - Named with convention: `bugfix/[issue-number]-[brief-description]`
   - Created from `main`
   - Merged back to `main` via pull request

4. **Hotfix Branches**
   - Named with convention: `hotfix/[issue-number]-[brief-description]`
   - Created from `main`
   - Merged back to `main` via pull request
   - May be cherry-picked to release branches

5. **Release Branches**
   - Named with convention: `release/v[major].[minor].[patch]`
   - Created from `main` when preparing a release
   - Only bugfixes merged into release branches

### Commit Guidelines

1. **Conventional Commits**
   - Format: `type(scope): subject`
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
   - Example: `feat(auth): add password reset functionality`

2. **Commit Best Practices**

   - Reference related issues
   - Assign reviewers

2. **Code Review**
   - At least one approval required
   - Address all comments
