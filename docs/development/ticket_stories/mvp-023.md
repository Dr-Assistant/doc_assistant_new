## Ticket Overview

This ticket implements the integration of Google Speech-to-Text API with the voice recording service to automatically convert audio recordings of doctor-patient conversations into text transcriptions. This is a critical component of the AI pipeline that enables downstream processing for clinical note generation and prescription extraction.

## The Story Behind the Ticket

### Business Context
In the Dr. Assistant platform, doctors record their conversations with patients during consultations. These audio recordings need to be converted to text to enable AI-powered analysis and generation of clinical notes. Manual transcription is time-consuming and error-prone, making automated transcription essential for the platform's efficiency.

### User Journey
1. **Doctor uploads audio recording** during or after a patient consultation
2. **System automatically triggers transcription** using Google Speech-to-Text
3. **AI processes the audio** with medical terminology optimization
4. **Transcription results are stored** with confidence scores and timing information
5. **Doctor can review transcription** before it's used for clinical note generation
6. **System provides quality metrics** to help doctors understand transcription accuracy

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Support for multiple audio formats (WAV, MP3, WebM, OGG)
- Medical terminology enhancement for better accuracy
- Speaker diarization to distinguish between doctor and patient
- Confidence scoring and quality metrics
- Retry mechanism for failed transcriptions
- Secure handling of sensitive medical audio data

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
The transcription service follows a microservice architecture pattern, integrating seamlessly with the existing voice recording service:

### Google Speech-to-Text Configuration

#### Audio Processing Optimization
```javascript
const defaultConfig = {
  encoding: 'WEBM_OPUS',
  sampleRateHertz: 48000,
  languageCode: 'en-US',
  enableAutomaticPunctuation: true,
  enableWordTimeOffsets: true,
  enableSpeakerDiarization: true,
  diarizationSpeakerCount: 2,
  model: 'latest_long',
  useEnhanced: true,
  enableWordConfidence: true,
  maxAlternatives: 3
};
```

#### Medical Terminology Enhancement
The service includes a curated list of medical terms that are boosted during recognition:
- Common conditions (hypertension, diabetes, pneumonia)
- Symptoms (dyspnea, chest pain, headache)
- Medications and dosages
- Medical procedures and tests
- Anatomical terms

### Quality Assessment Features

#### Confidence Scoring
- **Overall confidence** calculated from word-level scores
- **Low confidence word detection** for quality alerts
- **Alternative transcription options** for uncertain segments

#### Audio Quality Metrics
- **Silence duration calculation** to identify gaps in conversation
- **Background noise assessment** based on confidence patterns
- **Speaker identification** for multi-participant conversations

### Security and Privacy

#### Data Protection
- **Encrypted audio storage** using AES-256-GCM
- **Secure API communication** with Google Cloud
- **Access control** ensuring only authorized users can access transcriptions
- **Audit logging** for all transcription operations

#### Compliance Considerations
- **HIPAA-compliant** audio processing
- **Data retention policies** aligned with medical record requirements
- **Secure credential management** for Google Cloud authentication

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Audio Format Compatibility
**Problem:** Different devices and browsers produce audio in various formats
**Solution:** Implemented dynamic audio format detection and configuration mapping
```javascript
const encodingMap = {
  'audio/wav': 'LINEAR16',
  'audio/mpeg': 'MP3',
  'audio/mp4': 'MP3',
  'audio/webm': 'WEBM_OPUS',
  'audio/ogg': 'OGG_OPUS'
};
```

### Challenge 2: Medical Terminology Accuracy
**Problem:** Standard speech recognition often misinterprets medical terms
**Solution:** Implemented speech contexts with medical terminology boosting
```javascript
request.config.speechContexts = [{
  phrases: this.medicalTerms,
  boost: 10.0
}];
```

### Challenge 3: Long Audio Processing
**Problem:** Longer consultations require different processing approaches
**Solution:** Implemented dual processing modes:
- **Short audio (< 1 minute):** Synchronous recognition
- **Long audio (> 1 minute):** Long-running operations with polling

### Challenge 4: Error Handling and Reliability
**Problem:** Network issues and API limits can cause transcription failures
**Solution:** Comprehensive retry mechanism with exponential backoff
```javascript
const maxRetries = parseInt(process.env.MAX_TRANSCRIPTION_RETRIES || '3');
if (transcription.errorDetails?.retryCount >= maxRetries) {
  throw new ValidationError('Maximum retry attempts exceeded');
}
```
