## The Story Behind the Ticket

### Business Context
Prescription writing is a critical and time-consuming aspect of medical practice. Doctors must carefully consider medication names, dosages, frequencies, drug interactions, and patient-specific factors when prescribing medications. Manual prescription writing is prone to errors and can be inefficient, especially when extracting medication information from lengthy clinical notes or consultation transcriptions.

### User Journey
1. **Doctor completes patient consultation** with clinical documentation
2. **AI analyzes clinical note or transcription** to extract medication information
3. **System generates structured prescription** with proper dosing and instructions
4. **AI performs safety checks** including drug interactions and dosage validation
5. **Doctor reviews generated prescription** for accuracy and completeness
6. **Doctor edits and approves prescription** with digital signature
7. **System sends prescription to pharmacy** with complete audit trail
8. **Prescription integrates with patient record** for future reference

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro for AI extraction
- Support for multiple input sources (clinical notes, transcriptions, text)
- Comprehensive medication database with 15+ common drugs
- Drug interaction checking with severity levels
- Dosage validation against maximum daily doses
- Age-appropriate dosing recommendations
- Review and approval workflow

  endocrine: ['metformin', 'glipizide'],
  antibiotic: ['amoxicillin', 'azithromycin'],
  analgesic: ['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen'],
  respiratory: ['albuterol'],
  psychiatric: ['sertraline']
};
```

#### Drug Interaction Matrix

const interactions = {
  'metoprolol': {
    'verapamil': { severity: 'major', description: 'Increased risk of bradycardia and heart block' },
    'insulin': { severity: 'moderate', description: 'May mask hypoglycemia symptoms' }
  }
};
```

#### Dosage Guidelines
```javascript
const guidelines = {
  maxDailyDose: '400mg',
  ageAdjustments: { geriatric: 0.5 },
  renalAdjustment: true,
  hepaticAdjustment: false
};
```

### Google Gemini Prompt Engineering

#### Medical Context Optimization
The service uses sophisticated prompt engineering with:
- **Patient-specific context** including age, gender, weight, allergies
- **Medical specialty information** for specialized terminology
- **Structured JSON output format** for consistent parsing
- **Safety considerations** for drug interactions and dosing
- **Common medication database** for recognition enhancement

#### Extraction Prompt Structure
```javascript
const prompt = `
You are an expert clinical pharmacist specializing in prescription generation.

CONTEXT INFORMATION:
- Patient Age: ${age}
- Known Allergies: ${allergies}
- Current Medications: ${currentMeds}
- Specialty: ${specialty}

MEDICAL TEXT TO ANALYZE:
${text}

Extract medications with dosage, frequency, duration, route, and instructions.
Provide structured JSON output with confidence scores.
`;
```

### Safety Features Implementation

#### Drug Interaction Checking
```javascript
const checkInteractions = (medications) => {
  const interactions = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < medications.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < medications.length; j++) {
      const interaction = drugInteractions[med1]?.[med2];
      if (interaction) {
        interactions.push({
          severity: interaction.severity,
          description: interaction.description,
          recommendation: 'Monitor closely'
        });
      }
    }
  }
  return interactions;
};
```

#### Dosage Validation
```javascript
const validateDosage = (medication, patientInfo) => {
  const alerts = [];
  const dailyDose = calculateDailyDose(medication);
  const maxDose = getMaxDailyDose(medication.name);
  
  if (dailyDose > maxDose) {
    alerts.push({
      alertType: 'overdose',
      description: `Daily dose exceeds maximum`,
      recommendation: `Reduce to maximum ${maxDose}`
    });
  }
  
  return alerts;
};
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Medication Name Recognition
**Problem:** AI models may not recognize all medication names or confuse generic/brand names
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive medication database with generic/brand name mapping
```javascript
const findMedication = (name) => {
  // Direct match
  if (medications[name.toLowerCase()]) return medications[name.toLowerCase()];
  
  // Brand name search
  for (const [key, med] of Object.entries(medications)) {
    if (med.brandNames?.includes(name)) return med;
  }
  
  return null;
};
```

### Challenge 2: Dosage Extraction Accuracy
**Problem:** Dosages can be expressed in various formats and units
**Solution:** Multiple regex patterns with structured parsing
```javascript
const patterns = [
  /(\w+)\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(mg|mcg|g)\s+(once|twice|three times)\s+(daily)/i,
  /(\w+)\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(mg|mcg|g)\s+every\s+(\d+)\s+(hours)/i,
  /(\w+)\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(mg|mcg|g)\s+(bid|tid|qid|prn)/i
];
```

### Challenge 3: Drug Interaction Complexity
**Problem:** Complex drug interactions with varying severity levels
**Solution:** Structured interaction matrix with severity classification
```javascript
const drugInteractions = {
  'medication1': {
    'medication2': {
      severity: 'major|moderate|minor',
      description: 'Detailed interaction description',
      recommendation: 'Clinical recommendation'
    }
  }
};
```

### Challenge 4: Safety Validation
**Problem:** Ensuring prescription safety across different patient populations
**Solution:** Multi-layered safety checking system
```javascript
const safetyChecks = [
  checkDrugInteractions,
  validateDosages,
  checkAgeAppropriate,
  validateAllergyConflicts,
  checkRenalAdjustments
];
```
