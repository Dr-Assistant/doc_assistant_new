## Ticket Overview

This ticket implements a comprehensive AI-powered clinical note generation service using Google Gemini that converts doctor-patient conversation transcriptions into structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes. This service is a critical component of the AI pipeline that transforms raw conversation data into professional medical documentation.

## The Story Behind the Ticket

### Business Context
In healthcare, clinical documentation is essential for patient care continuity, legal compliance, and billing accuracy. Doctors spend significant time writing clinical notes after patient encounters, often taking 2-3 hours of documentation for every hour of patient care. This administrative burden reduces time available for patient care and contributes to physician burnout.

### User Journey
1. **Doctor completes patient consultation** with voice recording
2. **Transcription service converts audio to text** (MVP-023)
3. **AI analyzes transcription** and generates structured SOAP note
4. **Doctor reviews generated note** for accuracy and completeness
5. **Doctor edits and approves note** with digital signature
6. **System stores final note** with complete audit trail
7. **Note integrates with patient record** for future reference

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro for AI generation
- Structured SOAP note format with medical terminology
- Quality assessment and confidence scoring
- Review and approval workflow
- Edit tracking and audit trail
- ICD-10 code suggestions
- Medical terminology enhancement
- Compliance monitoring and quality checks

```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Medical Terminology Accuracy
**Problem:** Standard AI models often misinterpret medical terminology
**Solution:** Implemented medical context enhancement with 60+ medical terms
```javascript
const medicalTerms = [
  'hypertension', 'diabetes', 'pneumonia', 'bronchitis',
  'myocardial infarction', 'angina', 'arrhythmia', ...
];
```

### Challenge 2: Structured Output Consistency
**Problem:** AI responses can be inconsistent in format and structure
**Solution:** Dual parsing approach with JSON primary and regex fallback
```javascript
const parsedNote = this.parseSoapNote(generatedText);
// Falls back to regex extraction if JSON parsing fails
```

### Challenge 3: Quality Assessment
**Problem:** Determining the quality and reliability of AI-generated content
**Solution:** Multi-dimensional quality assessment algorithm
```javascript
const qualityMetrics = {
  completeness: this.assessCompleteness(soapNote),
  accuracy: this.assessAccuracy(soapNote),
  relevance: this.assessRelevance(soapNote),
  clarity: this.assessClarity(soapNote)
};
```

### Challenge 4: Integration with Existing Services
**Problem:** Seamless integration with transcription and patient services
**Solution:** Service-to-service communication with fallback mechanisms
```javascript
const transcriptionData = await this.getTranscriptionData(transcriptionId);
const patientInfo = await this.getPatientInfo(patientId);
```

### Challenge 5: Review Workflow Management
**Problem:** Complex approval workflow with multiple stakeholders
**Solution:** State-based workflow with audit trail
```javascript
const workflowStates = ['generating', 'draft', 'review', 'approved', 'signed'];
```
