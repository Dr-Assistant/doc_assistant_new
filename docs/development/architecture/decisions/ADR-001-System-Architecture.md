# ADR-001: System Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Dr. Assistant application requires a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture that can support various features including user management, patient management, scheduling, AI-powered voice transcription, clinical note generation, and integration with external systems like ABDM. We need to make decisions about the overall system architecture, service boundaries, communication patterns, and deployment strategy.

## Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Web Application: React with TypeScript and Material UI
  - Mobile Application: React Native
  - State Management: Redux/Context API

- **Backend**:
  - Core Services: Node.js with Express/NestJS and TypeScript
  - AI Services: Python with FastAPI
  - API Gateway: Express-based custom gateway

- **Data Storage**:
  - Primary Database: PostgreSQL for structured data
  - Document Store: MongoDB for flexible schema data (clinical notes, AI outputs)
  - Cache: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
  - Search: Elasticsearch (to be added in future phases)
  - Object Storage: AWS S3 or compatible alternative for large files

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Containerization: Docker
  - Orchestration: Kubernetes (for production)
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  - Cloud Provider: AWS (primary choice for production)

### 2. Service Boundaries

We will organize services based on business domains:

- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization
- **User Service**: User profile management
- **Patient Service**: Patient data management
- **Schedule Service**: Appointment scheduling
- **Encounter Service**: Clinical encounter management
- **Task Service**: Task management
- **Notification Service**: Notification delivery
- **Document Service**: Document management
- **Search Service**: Search functionality
- **Analytics Service**: Reporting and analytics
- **AI Services**:
  - Voice Transcription Service
  - Clinical Note Generation Service
  - Prescription Generation Service
  - Pre-Diagnosis Summary Service
- **Integration Services**:
  - ABDM Integration Service
  - EHR Integration Service (future)
  - Lab Integration Service (future)
  - Pharmacy Integration Service (future)

### 3. Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for direct request-response interactions
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Message queues for background processing
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets for real-time notifications and updates
- **Service Discovery**: DNS-based service discovery in Kubernetes

### 4. Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Testing/Staging**: Kubernetes cluster with namespaces
- **Production**: Kubernetes cluster with proper resource allocation and scaling
- **Deployment Process**: CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- **Release Strategy**: Blue/green deployments for zero-downtime updates

### 5. Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, CORS
- **Compliance**: DPDP Act and ABDM requirements

## Consequences

### Advantages

1. **Scalability**: Services can scale independently based on demand
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies as appropriate
4. **Resilience**: Failures in one service don't necessarily affect others
5. **Team Organization**: Teams can work on different services independently

### Challenges

1. **Complexity**: Microservices introduce operational complexity
2. **Data Consistency**: Maintaining data consistency across services requires careful design
3. **Service Communication**: Managing inter-service communication adds overhead
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Deploying and monitoring multiple services is more complex
5. **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn multiple technologies and tools

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core services and gradually add more as needed
2. **Standardization**: Use consistent patterns and libraries across services
3. **Automation**: Automate deployment, monitoring, and scaling as much as possible
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of service interfaces and dependencies
5. **Observability**: Implement robust logging, monitoring, and tracing

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up the basic infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline
2. Implement core services (Auth, User, Patient, Schedule)
3. Develop frontend applications that consume these services
4. Add AI services and integration services
5. Implement advanced features and optimizations
