# ADR-003: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Dr. Assistant application requires a secure authentication and authorization system to protect sensitive patient data and ensure that users can only access the resources they are authorized to use. We need to decide on the authentication mechanism, token management, authorization model, and security implementation details.

## Decision

We will implement a JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

### 1. Authentication

#### JWT-based Authentication

- **Token Format**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Token Contents**:
  - User ID
  - User email
  - User role
  - Token expiration time
  - Token issuance time
  - Token unique identifier
- **Token Signing**: HMAC SHA-256 (HS256) algorithm with a secure secret key
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire after 1 hour, refresh tokens after 7 days
- **Token Storage**:
  - Frontend: HttpOnly cookies for web application, secure storage for mobile
  - Backend: Refresh tokens stored in database with user association

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - User provides email, password, and required profile information
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
   - User account is created with 'pending' status
   - Verification email is sent (for email verification)
   - Upon verification, user status is updated to 'active'

2. **Login**:
   - User provides email and password
   - System verifies credentials against stored hash
   - If valid, system generates access token and refresh token
   - Tokens are returned to the client
   - Login attempt is logged (successful or failed)

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - Client sends refresh token when access token expires
   - System validates refresh token
   - If valid, system generates new access token
   - New access token is returned to the client
   - Refresh token rotation is implemented for security

4. **Logout**:
   - Client sends logout request with access token
   - System invalidates the refresh token
   - Client clears tokens from storage

### 2. Authorization

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**:
  - Doctor: Primary healthcare provider
  - Admin: System administrator with elevated privileges
  - Future roles: Nurse, Receptionist, etc.

- **Permission Model**:
  - Resource-based permissions (e.g., 'read:patients', 'write:prescriptions')
  - Role-based permission assignments
  - Hierarchical permission inheritance

- **Access Control Implementation**:
  - Middleware-based authorization checks
  - Service-level permission verification
  - Data-level access control (row-level security in database)

### 3. Security Measures

- **Password Security**:
  - Minimum password strength requirements
  - Bcrypt hashing with appropriate work factor
  - Password reset functionality with secure tokens

- **Token Security**:
  - Short-lived access tokens
  - Secure token storage
  - Token validation on every request
  - Token revocation capability

- **API Security**:
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  - HTTPS for all communications
  - CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access
  - Input validation to prevent injection attacks

- **Audit Logging**:
  - Authentication events (login, logout, token refresh)
  - Authorization failures
  - Sensitive data access
  - Account changes

### 4. Implementation Details

- **Authentication Service**:
  - Dedicated microservice for authentication and authorization
  - Exposes APIs for registration, login, token refresh, and logout
  - Manages user credentials and tokens

- **API Gateway Integration**:
  - Token validation at the API gateway level
  - Request enrichment with user context
  - Rate limiting and basic security checks

- **Service-to-Service Authentication**:
  - Service accounts with appropriate permissions
  - Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
  - API keys for external integrations

## Consequences

### Advantages

1. **Security**: JWT provides a secure, stateless authentication mechanism
2. **Scalability**: Stateless authentication supports horizontal scaling
3. **Flexibility**: RBAC allows for fine-grained access control
4. **Standards-Based**: Uses widely adopted security standards and practices
5. **User Experience**: Token refresh provides seamless authentication experience

### Challenges

1. **Token Management**: Proper handling of token expiration and refresh
2. **Security Risks**: JWT tokens must be properly secured to prevent theft
3. **Complexity**: RBAC implementation can become complex with many roles and permissions
4. **Performance**: Token validation adds some overhead to each request
5. **Revocation**: Stateless tokens are harder to revoke before expiration

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Short Lifetimes**: Use short-lived access tokens to minimize risk
2. **Secure Storage**: Implement secure token storage on client and server
3. **Refresh Token Rotation**: Rotate refresh tokens to prevent reuse
4. **Blacklisting**: Implement token blacklisting for critical security events
5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and audit the authentication system

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement the Authentication Service with basic registration and login
2. Set up JWT token generation and validation
3. Implement refresh token functionality
4. Develop role-based authorization middleware
5. Integrate authentication with the API gateway
6. Implement audit logging for security events
7. Set up monitoring and alerting for security incidents
