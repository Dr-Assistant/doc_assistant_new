## TDR-001: Microservices Architecture

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The Dr. Assistant platform needs to support multiple features including authentication, user management, patient management, scheduling, voice recording, AI processing, and more. We need to decide on the overall architectural approach that will allow for scalability, maintainability, and independent development and deployment of different components.

Traditional monolithic architectures can be simpler to develop initially but may present challenges as the system grows in complexity and team size increases. Microservices offer better scalability and team autonomy but introduce distributed systems challenges.

### Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture for the Dr. Assistant platform, with services organized around business capabilities.

### Options Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - Single codebase for all features
   - Simpler initial development
   - Shared database
   - Single deployment unit

2. **Modular Monolith**
   - Single deployment unit with clear internal module boundaries
   - Shared database with schema ownership by modules
   - Potential for future decomposition into microservices

3. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Independent services organized around business capabilities
   - Separate databases per service
   - Independent deployment
   - Service-to-service communication via APIs

4. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Function-based decomposition
   - Managed scaling and infrastructure
   - Event-driven design
   - Pay-per-use pricing model

### Decision Criteria

- **Scalability**: Ability to scale individual components based on demand

- **Technology Flexibility**: Ability to use different technologies for different components
- **Deployment Independence**: Ability to deploy components independently
- **Development Speed**: Impact on development velocity
- **Operational Complexity**: Effort required to operate and maintain the system
- **Cost Efficiency**: Resource utilization and infrastructure costs

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Independent scaling of services based on demand (e.g., AI processing can scale independently of user management)
- Teams can work autonomously on different services
- Technology choices can be optimized for each service's requirements
- Services can be deployed independently, reducing risk and enabling faster releases
- Better fault isolation, preventing a single issue from taking down the entire system
- Clearer ownership boundaries for different parts of the system

#### Negative
- Increased operational complexity with multiple services to deploy and monitor
- Distributed systems challenges (network latency, partial failures, eventual consistency)
- Need for service discovery, API gateway, and other supporting infrastructure
- More complex testing, especially for end-to-end scenarios
- Potential for duplication of code and effort across services
- Learning curve for developers new to microservices

### Implementation Notes

- Services will be containerized using Docker
- Kubernetes will be used for orchestration
- Each service will have its own database or schema
- Service-to-service communication will primarily use RESTful APIs
- Event-driven communication will be used for asynchronous processes
- API Gateway will handle external requests, authentication, and routing
- Service boundaries will be defined based on business capabilities, not technical layers

## TDR-003: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The Dr. Assistant platform handles sensitive healthcare data and requires a robust authentication and authorization system. We need to ensure secure access to the application while providing a good user experience. The system must comply with healthcare data protection regulations and support various user roles with different permission levels.

### Decision
We will implement a token-based authentication system using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect with JWT (JSON Web Tokens), combined with a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for authorization.

### Options Considered

1. **Session-based Authentication**
   - Server-side sessions with cookies
   - Traditional approach with proven security
   - Requires session storage on the server

2. **Token-based Authentication (JWT)**
   - Stateless authentication with signed tokens
   - No server-side session storage required
   - Tokens contain claims about the user

3. **OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect**
   - Industry standard for authentication and authorization
   - Support for various grant types
   - Potential for third-party identity provider integration

4. **Custom Authentication System**
   - Built specifically for our needs
   - Complete control over implementation
   - Higher development and maintenance cost

**Authorization Approaches:**
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Permissions assigned to roles, roles assigned to users
   - Simpler to manage for administrators
   - May lack granularity for complex permissions

2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Permissions based on user attributes, resource attributes, and context
   - More flexible and granular than RBAC
   - More complex to implement and manage

3. **Permission-Based Access Control**
   - Direct assignment of permissions to users
   - Fine-grained control
   - Can become unwieldy with many users and permissions

### Decision Criteria

- **Security**: Protection against common vulnerabilities and attacks
- **Compliance**: Alignment with healthcare data protection regulations
- **User Experience**: Minimal friction for legitimate users
- **Scalability**: Performance under load and with growing user base
- **Maintainability**: Ease of implementation and ongoing management
- **Flexibility**: Support for different authentication flows and user types

### Consequences

#### Positive
- JWT tokens enable stateless authentication, improving scalability
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect provides a standardized, secure authentication framework
- RBAC simplifies permission management through role assignments
- Support for different authentication flows (password, refresh token, etc.)
- Potential for future integration with third-party identity providers
- Clear separation between authentication and authorization concerns

#### Negative
- JWT token revocation requires additional mechanisms (blacklisting or short expiry with refresh tokens)
- RBAC may require role proliferation for very granular permissions
- More complex initial setup compared to simple username/password authentication
- Need to manage token expiration and refresh flows
- Requires secure token storage on client devices

### Implementation Notes

- Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with longer-lived refresh tokens
- Implement token refresh mechanism to maintain user sessions
- Store tokens securely (HttpOnly cookies for web, secure storage for mobile)
- Implement HTTPS for all API communications
- Use a dedicated authentication service within our microservices architecture
- Define a core set of roles (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, etc.)
- Implement permission checks at the API gateway and service levels
- Use a claims-based approach in JWTs to include user roles and key attributes
- Implement comprehensive logging of authentication and authorization events

## TDR-006: API Design Standards

### Status
Accepted

### Context
As we build a microservices-based platform, APIs become the primary means of communication between services and with client applications. Consistent, well-designed APIs are crucial for developer productivity, system maintainability, and overall performance. We need to establish standards for API design to ensure consistency across the platform.

### Decision
We will adopt a hybrid API approach with GraphQL as the primary API technology for client-facing services, complemented by RESTful APIs for service-to-service communication and specific use cases. All APIs will follow a set of design standards for consistency and quality.

### Options Considered
