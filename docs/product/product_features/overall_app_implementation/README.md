# Overall App Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains high-level documentation about how the Dr. Assistant application works as a complete system, focusing on end-to-end workflows and user experiences. It provides a holistic view of how all features work together to deliver a seamless experience for doctors.

> **Note for Developers**: All technical implementation documentation has been moved to the `/docs/development` directory. Please refer to that directory for technical documentation, including architecture details, implementation plans, and development workflows.

## Key System Components

The Dr. Assistant application consists of several integrated components that work together:

- **Frontend Application** - React-based user interface for doctors
- **Backend Services** - Microservices handling different aspects of the application
- **AI Processing Pipeline** - Services for voice transcription, summarization, and prescription generation
- **Integration Layer** - Connectors to EHR systems and other healthcare platforms
- **Data Storage** - Databases and caching systems for application data
- **Security Layer** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms

## Technology Stack

The application is built using modern technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/NestJS
- **AI/ML**: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure
- **Integration**: FHIR-compliant APIs, HL7 messaging

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Microservices Architecture** - Modular, independently deployable services
2. **API-First Design** - Well-defined interfaces between components
3. **Event-Driven Communication** - Asynchronous messaging for scalability
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works without advanced features
5. **Security by Design** - Privacy and security built into every component
6. **Continuous Integration/Deployment** - Automated testing and deployment pipelines
