## Design Principles

### 1. Clean Card-Based Layout
- Each section is contained in a distinct card with subtle shadows
- Ample white space to reduce visual clutter
- Rounded corners for a modern, friendly appearance

### 2. Color Scheme
- Primary: Calming blue (#1976D2) for headers and key elements
- Secondary: Teal accent (#00BCD4) for interactive elements
- Alert colors: Yellow (#FFC107) for warnings, Red (#F44336) for critical items
- Neutral background with white cards for content

### 3. Typography
- Sans-serif font family (e.g., Inter or SF Pro) for clean readability
- Variable font weights to create visual hierarchy
- Larger font size (16px base) for better readability

### 4. Interactive Elements
- Hover effects on cards and buttons
- Subtle animations for state changes
- Expandable sections for additional details

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **Dashboard Overview**

   - So that I can prioritize and complete important administrative work

4. **Alert Monitoring**
   - As a doctor, I want to be notified of critical patient updates or urgent messages
   - So that I can respond quickly to time-sensitive matters

5. **Patient Preparation**
   - As a doctor, I want to see a summary of my next patient
   - So that I can quickly refresh my memory before the appointment

6. **Practice Metrics**
