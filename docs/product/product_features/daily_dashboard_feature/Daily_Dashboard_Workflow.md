# Daily Dashboard Workflow: End-to-End Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of how the Daily Dashboard feature works from end to end, including the interactions between different system components and a practical example of a doctor's workflow.

## What is an EHR System?

An **Electronic Health Record (EHR) System** is a digital version of a patient's paper medical chart. It contains a patient's medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results. Examples include Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts. In our architecture, the EHR system serves as the primary source of clinical data that feeds into our dashboard.

## System Components Overview

1. **EHR System**: The external medical records system that stores all patient data
2. **Backend Services**: Our application's server-side components that process and manage data
3. **Dashboard Frontend**: The user interface doctors interact with
4. **Database**: Our application's data storage for user preferences and application-specific data
5. **Integration Layer**: Connects our system with the EHR and other healthcare systems

## End-to-End Workflow Example

Let's follow Dr. Sarah, a general practitioner, through her day using the Daily Dashboard:

### Step 1: Authentication and Initial Load

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah logs into the Dr. Assistant application at 8:45 AM.

**System Workflow**:
1. The frontend sends authentication credentials to the AuthService in our backend
2. AuthService validates credentials and generates a JWT token
3. The frontend receives the token and stores it for subsequent API calls
4. The Dashboard component initiates parallel requests to load all dashboard sections

**Technical Process**:
```
Frontend → AuthService → Database (verify credentials) → Frontend (store token)
Frontend → Backend Services → EHR System (multiple API calls) → Backend → Frontend
```

**Data Flow**:
- ScheduleService requests today's appointments from the EHR system
- TaskService fetches pending tasks (unsigned notes, lab reviews)
- AlertService retrieves critical notifications
- PatientService gets information about the next patient
- AnalyticsService calculates practice metrics

### Step 2: Viewing Today's Schedule

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah reviews her appointment timeline for the day.

**System Workflow**:
1. The ScheduleTimeline component displays appointments retrieved during initial load
2. Real-time updates are pushed via WebSockets if any appointment status changes
3. Each appointment card shows patient name, time, and status (booked, checked-in)

**Technical Process**:
```
EHR System → IntegrationService → WebSocket Server → Frontend (real-time updates)
```

**Example Data**:
- 9:00 AM: John Smith (Checked-in) - Annual physical
- 10:30 AM: Mary Jones (Confirmed) - Hypertension follow-up
- 11:15 AM: David Lee (Booked) - Diabetes management
- 1:00 PM: Sarah Chen (Booked) - Medication review
- 2:15 PM: Mike Brown (Booked) - Skin rash
- 3:30 PM: Emma Davis (Booked) - Prenatal check-up

### Step 3: Managing Pending Tasks

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah notices she has unsigned prescriptions from yesterday.

**System Workflow**:
1. The TaskList component shows prioritized tasks fetched from the TaskService
2. Dr. Sarah clicks on "Sign 3 prescriptions" task
3. The system navigates to the prescription signing interface
4. After signing, the TaskService updates the task status in our database and the EHR

**Technical Process**:
```
Frontend (click) → Router (navigation) → PrescriptionComponent
PrescriptionComponent → TaskService → EHR System (update prescription status)
TaskService → Database (update task completion) → WebSocket → Frontend (update task list)
```

**Example Task Flow**:
1. Task displayed: "Sign 3 prescriptions"
2. Dr. Sarah reviews and signs each prescription
3. Task is marked complete and removed from dashboard
4. Dashboard updates in real-time

### Step 4: Responding to Alerts

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah sees a critical lab result alert for patient John Smith.

**System Workflow**:
1. The AlertPanel displays the critical alert with patient name and alert type
2. Dr. Sarah clicks on the alert to view details
3. The system navigates to the lab result view showing the abnormal values
4. After reviewing, Dr. Sarah can take action (call patient, order follow-up)

**Technical Process**:
```
Frontend (click) → Router (navigation) → LabResultComponent
LabResultComponent → PatientService → EHR System (fetch detailed lab data)
AlertService → Database (mark alert as reviewed) → WebSocket → Frontend (update alerts)
```

**Example Alert Handling**:
1. Alert shown: "⚠️ Critical lab result - John Smith - Elevated potassium"
2. Dr. Sarah reviews the detailed lab report
3. She calls the patient to come in immediately
4. She marks the alert as handled, which updates the dashboard

### Step 5: Preparing for Next Patient

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah checks the patient summary for her next appointment.

**System Workflow**:
1. The PatientSummary component displays information about Mary Jones
2. The component shows demographic info, reason for visit, allergies, and recent vitals
3. Dr. Sarah can click to view the full patient record if needed

**Technical Process**:
```
Frontend (PatientSummary) → PatientService → EHR System (fetch patient details)
Frontend (click) → Router (navigation) → PatientRecordComponent (if full record requested)
```

**Example Patient Summary**:
- Name: Mary Jones
- Age: 45, Female
- Reason: Hypertension follow-up
- Allergies: Penicillin
- Last Visit: 3 months ago
- Recent Vitals: BP 138/85, HR 72, Temp 98.6°F

### Step 6: Monitoring Practice Metrics

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah glances at her practice metrics.

**System Workflow**:
1. The MetricsDisplay component shows visualizations of key performance indicators
2. Data is pre-calculated by the AnalyticsService during dashboard load
3. Charts update periodically or when relevant events occur

**Technical Process**:
```
AnalyticsService → Database (query historical data) → Calculate metrics → Frontend
```

**Example Metrics**:
- Today's Progress: 60% (6/10 patients seen)
- Average Wait Time: 12 minutes (with trend line showing fluctuations)
- Patient Satisfaction: 4.8/5 (based on recent feedback)

### Step 7: Using Quick Actions

**User Action**: Dr. Sarah needs to add a lab order for Mary Jones after her visit.

**System Workflow**:
1. Dr. Sarah clicks the "+ Lab Order" quick action button
2. The system opens the lab order form pre-populated with Mary's information
3. After completing the order, the system sends it to the EHR and updates the dashboard

**Technical Process**:
```
Frontend (click) → Router (navigation) → LabOrderComponent
LabOrderComponent → PatientService → Pre-populate form
LabOrderComponent → EHR System (submit order) → TaskService (create follow-up task)
```

**Example Quick Action Flow**:
1. Dr. Sarah clicks "+ Lab Order"
2. She selects "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel" for Mary
3. She submits the order which is sent to the EHR
4. A new task "Check lab results for Mary Jones" is scheduled for next week

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Flow Architecture

The system uses a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer** (Frontend):
   - React components render the UI
   - React Query or Redux manages state
   - WebSocket connection listens for real-time updates

2. **Application Layer** (Backend Services):
   - RESTful APIs handle CRUD operations
   - Service classes implement business logic
   - WebSocket server pushes updates to connected clients

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - FHIR adapters translate between our system and EHR
   - Message queues handle asynchronous processing
   - API gateways manage authentication and routing

4. **Data Layer**:
   - EHR system stores clinical data
   - Our database stores application-specific data
   - Redis cache improves performance for frequently accessed data

### 2. Real-Time Updates

The dashboard stays current through several mechanisms:

1. **WebSockets**: Maintain persistent connections for immediate updates
2. **Polling**: Regular API calls for less critical data
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Backend services emit events when data changes
4. **Optimistic UI Updates**: Frontend updates immediately, then confirms with backend

### 3. Caching Strategy

To ensure fast performance:

1. **Browser Cache**: Static assets and UI components
2. **Application Cache**: User preferences and reference data
3. **Redis Cache**: Frequently accessed clinical data
4. **Memory Cache**: In-memory caching for backend services

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience

The system is designed to be robust:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If EHR is unavailable, show cached data
2. **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatically retry failed API calls
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
4. **Fallback Content**: Display alternative content when data can't be loaded
